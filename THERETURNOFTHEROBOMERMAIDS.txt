Adrift alone
in a cyber stream
of computed waves
A stray drop bounces
hits me
like a drumstick
$Beep!

Its echo jitters
and I'm thirsty
for its sound
I let my ear fall
in the water
in the silence:
$Boop!

Bubbles pop
Eyelids drop
"Come closer!"
Says a voice
or it does not
it just beeps
and boops
non-stop

$Beep
$boop
$beep
$beep
$boop
$beep
$boop
$beep
$boop

"Follow me!"
Says the beep
"Or I follow you?"
Says the boop
Now it's louder
now I'm closer
to the loop

The stream takes me
to the source
like a tree falls
in its root
$Beep
$boop

The stream is flat
and yet so steep
A horizontal fall
towards the leak
of sound:
countless droplets
flow in my ears
$Beep
$boop
$beep

What awaits me
at the end
a cyber-mermaid
robotic muse
"You're almost there!"
$Boop.
